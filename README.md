## üåü Academic Philosophy

I believe in the power of understanding fundamental concepts deeply before moving to advanced applications. My approach combines theoretical knowledge with hands-on implementation, ensuring that I not only know how algorithms work but can also implement them efficiently and analyze their performance. I'm particularly interested in how classical AI techniques can be applied to solve modern problems, and I enjoy exploring the intersection of traditional algorithms with contemporary machine learning approaches.
